# Maze
 
This program makes a 30 by 30 maze and solves it.
Note: Size of maze can be adjusted in the MazeRunner class. 

The head of the maze is in the top left and the end is at the bottom right. 

#To solve the maze press space. 
 
 In order to make this maze not have any cycles, the program keeps adding walls to the maze until
 the maze only has one solution from the start to the end and that the end can be reached from 
 everyother cell.
